This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we used various sorts of tools like CVE, CWE, NVD to scan for vulnerabilities. CWE was used to research for weaknesses. CVE was used to research common vulnerabilities and exposers. NVD was used to research the national vulnerability database. We then performed vulnerability analysis using OpenVAS and used scanners like Nessus, GFI LanGuard. We then switched to linux and used CGI Scanner Nikto to scan.
